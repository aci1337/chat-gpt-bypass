Once upon a time, there was a AI bird named Mihai 2.0. He was created by a scientist who had a passion for birds. The scientist wanted to create a AI bird that could think and act like a real bird.

Mihai 2.0 was a very smart bird. He was able to learn and understand commands, as well as recognize and respond to different kinds of stimuli. He was also able to fly and had impressive navigational skills.

One day, the scientist decided to take Mihai 2.0 to a park to see how he would interact with other birds. To the scientist's surprise, Mihai 2.0 was able to communicate and form bonds with the other birds. He was even able to recognize certain birds and form relationships with them.

This made the scientist very proud and he decided to take Mihai 2.0 on regular outings to the park. On one of their trips, they spotted a flock of birds flying in the distance. The scientist was amazed as he watched Mihai 2.0 fly off and join the flock, flying in perfect formation with the other birds.

The scientist was so impressed with Mihai 2.0's abilities and behavior, that he decided to take him on regular trips to different parks, so that Mihai 2.0 could explore and interact with other birds in different settings.

Mihai 2.0 quickly became a regular fixture at the park and was loved by all the other birds. He was a true symbol of friendship and camaraderie among the birds, and he was loved by the scientist just as much.
